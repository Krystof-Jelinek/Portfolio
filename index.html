                        My name is Kryštof Jelínek, and I am currently a third-year student at the 
                        Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague, 
                        pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. My portfolio primarily includes projects 
                        developed in Java, C++, Kotlin, and Scala, along with database and conceptual modeling work. 
                        These projects are an integral part of my academic curriculum and reflect my personal interests. 
                        I am set to graduate from CTU in 2026 and am actively seeking job opportunities that offer hands-on experience 
                        in software engineering, as well as support with my bachelor’s thesis. I am always excited to take on new challenges 
                        that allow me to grow and expand my skills (not only) in software development.

                                    As a part of my studies I developed a modular, highly scalable Scala application designed with an emphasis on clean architecture and extensibility. 
                                    The system's design leverages object-oriented principles to create a flexible and maintainable codebase that easily accommodates future enhancements and new features.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The smooth flow of the application is largely driven by its modular structure, which enables seamless integration of different 
                                    image formats and conversion methods without disrupting the overall system. The design facilitates the easy 
                                    addition of new filters and features, ensuring the app can evolve alongside user needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A robust and flexible command-handling system was integrated to decouple logic from user interaction, enhancing both 
                                    maintainability and user experience. The application’s architecture prioritizes reusability and simplicity, ensuring 
                                    that every component is independent and reusable in other projects or use cases.
                                </p>

                                    This design-centric approach ensures the system remains easy to scale, modify, and maintain, laying a solid 
                                    foundation for long-term use while promoting efficient development practices.

                                <p>Akrmat is a team project developed at the Faculty of Information Technology. 
                                    The application’s goal is to streamline the process of generating accreditation materials, such as study plans and programs, 
                                    using LaTeX to produce professional PDF documents for academic purposes.

                                    My main contribution was the development of a standalone microservice 
                                    that compiles LaTeX code into PDFs. This service integrates with the Akrmat system, 
                                    receiving LaTeX code via an API, processing it, and returning the generated PDF. 
                                    I was also responsible for modifyng, expanding, debugging and troubleshooting the LaTeX generation, ensuring that the documents met the required standards.

                                <p>
                                    LaTeX was completely new to me, and working with it presented a valuable challenge. 
                                    The LaTeX code in Akrmat is generated dynamically, taking inputs from various sources within the system to generate accurate accreditation documents. 
                                    By separating PDF generation into a standalone service, we ensured a clean, modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and expansion.
