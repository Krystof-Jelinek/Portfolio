                        My name is Kryštof Jelínek, and I am currently a third-year student at the 
                        Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague, 
                        pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. My portfolio primarily includes projects 
                        developed in Java, C++, Kotlin, and Scala, along with database and conceptual modeling work. 
                        These projects are an integral part of my academic curriculum and reflect my personal interests. 
                        I am set to graduate from CTU in 2026 and am actively seeking job opportunities that offer hands-on experience 
                        in software engineering, as well as support with my bachelor’s thesis. I am always excited to take on new challenges 
                        that allow me to grow and expand my skills (not only) in software development.

                                    As a part of my studies I developed a modular, highly scalable Scala application designed with an emphasis on clean architecture and extensibility. 
                                    The system's design leverages object-oriented principles to create a flexible and maintainable codebase that easily accommodates future enhancements and new features.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The smooth flow of the application is largely driven by its modular structure, which enables seamless integration of different 
                                    image formats and conversion methods without disrupting the overall system. The design facilitates the easy 
                                    addition of new filters and features, ensuring the app can evolve alongside user needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A robust and flexible command-handling system was integrated to decouple logic from user interaction, enhancing both 
                                    maintainability and user experience. The application’s architecture prioritizes reusability and simplicity, ensuring 
                                    that every component is independent and reusable in other projects or use cases.
                                </p>

                                    This design-centric approach ensures the system remains easy to scale, modify, and maintain, laying a solid 
                                    foundation for long-term use while promoting efficient development practices.

                                <p>Akrmat is a team project developed at the Faculty of Information Technology. 
                                    The application’s goal is to streamline the process of generating accreditation materials, such as study plans and programs, 
                                    using LaTeX to produce professional PDF documents for academic purposes.

                                    My main contribution was the development of a standalone microservice 
                                    that compiles LaTeX code into PDFs. This service integrates with the Akrmat system, 
                                    receiving LaTeX code via an API, processing it, and returning the generated PDF. 
                                    I was also responsible for modifyng, expanding, debugging and troubleshooting the LaTeX generation, ensuring that the documents met the required standards.

                                    LaTeX was completely new to me, and working with it presented a valuable challenge. 
                                    The LaTeX code in Akrmat is generated dynamically, taking inputs from various sources within the system to generate accurate accreditation documents. 
                                    By separating PDF generation into a standalone service, we ensured a clean, modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and expansion.

                                <p>This project implements a powerful engine for a spreadsheet processor that simulates the behavior of a 
                                    table similar to tools like Excel or Google Sheets. Built using C++, the application focuses on accurately processing cells, 
                                    formulas, and detecting cyclic dependencies between them. It is designed with an object-oriented approach, utilizing inheritance 
                                    and polymorphism to model a variety of cell types and operations that can be performed on them.

                                    The core functionality revolves around:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Cell Handling: Each cell in the spreadsheet can contain different types of data, 
                                            including static values (such as numbers or text) or dynamic content (formulas that reference other cells).
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>
                                            Formula Evaluation: The processor can parse and compute formulas using a sophisticated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 
                                            stored in each cell. This allows for more efficient and accurate evaluations of formula results.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>
                                            Cyclic Dependency Detection: One of the key features of the engine is its ability to detect 
                                            and manage cyclic dependencies between cells. This ensures that the processor does not enter an 
                                            infinite loop when a formula relies on the value of a cell that in turn depends on the original cell.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>
                                            External Parser Integration: The engine integrates an external parser for formula input, 
                                            ensuring a smooth and flexible way of reading and processing user-defined formulas.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>

                                    This project is centered around modeling the car repair service domain using various 
                                    modeling languages, including OntoUML, UML, BPMN, and DEMO. The main goal was to design a comprehensive 
                                    model of the domain, starting with the creation of an OntoUML diagram that identifies the 
                                    core entities involved in the auto repair service and defines the relationships between them. 
                                    The OntoUML model captures both the conceptual and structural aspects of the domain, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.

                                <p>
                                    integrity constraints were defined using OCL (Object Constraint Language) to 
                                    ensure the model’s consistency and correctness. The system automatically 
                                    checked for potential antipatterns within the OntoUML model
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to modeling the overall workflow, individual transactions were also modeled 
                                    within the system using DEMO (Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations). 
                                    DEMO was used to capture the specific actions and interactions that occur in the system’s transactional processes, 
                                    ensuring that these processes align with the defined business rules and organizational structure.

                                    Finally, an OCD (Organization Conceptual Diagram) was created to represent the structure 
                                    of the organization itself, outlining the roles, responsibilities, and relationships 
                                    between different organizational entities. This diagram provided a clear and comprehensive view of the organizational hierarchy.
