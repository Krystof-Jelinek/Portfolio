                        Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague, 
                        pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. My portfolio primarily includes projects 
                        developed in Java, C++, Kotlin, and Python, along with database and conceptual modeling work. 
                        These projects are an integral part of my academic curriculum and reflect my personal interests. 
                        I am set to graduate from CTU in 2026 and am actively seeking job opportunities that offer hands-on experience 
                        in software engineering, as well as support with my bachelor’s thesis. I am always excited to take on new challenges 
                        that allow me to grow and expand my skills (not only) in software development.

                                    The application’s goal is to streamline the process of generating accreditation materials, such as study plans and programs, 
                                    using LaTeX to produce professional PDF documents for academic purposes.

                                    My main contribution was the development of a standalone microservice 
                                    that compiles LaTeX code into PDFs. This service integrates with the Akrmat system, 
                                    receiving LaTeX code via an API, processing it, and returning the generated PDF. 
                                    I was also responsible for modifyng, expanding, debugging and troubleshooting the LaTeX generation, ensuring that the documents met the required standards.

                                    LaTeX was completely new to me, and working with it presented a valuable challenge. 
                                    The LaTeX code in Akrmat is generated dynamically, taking inputs from various sources within the system to generate accurate accreditation documents. 
                                    By separating PDF generation into a standalone service, we ensured a clean, modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and expansion.

                                    This project is an advanced Tetris application developed using Python and the Pyglet 
                                    library for high-performance graphics rendering and input handling. The primary goal 
                                    was to go beyond basic gameplay by creating a robust, extensible engine built on 
                                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring a strict separation between 
                                    game logic, networking, and the user interface.

                                    The standout feature is the LAN multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete in 
                                    real-time via socket communication. To enhance gameplay depth, I implemented a 
                                    "Modular Ability System." This architecture allows for the seamless integration of 
                                    unique player abilities and offensive modifiers (attacks) without altering the 
                                    core engine, utilizing design patterns to maintain scalability.

                                    Code quality and stability were central to the development process. The project

                                    The system's modularity ensures that components such as the network handler,

                                    This project is centered around modeling the car repair service domain using various 
                                    modeling languages, including OntoUML, UML, BPMN, and DEMO. The main goal was to design a comprehensive 
                                    model of the domain, starting with the creation of an OntoUML diagram that identifies the 
                                    core entities involved in the auto repair service and defines the relationships between them. 
                                    The OntoUML model captures both the conceptual and structural aspects of the domain, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.

                                    DEMO was used to capture the specific actions and interactions that occur in the system’s transactional processes,

                                            Formula Evaluation: The processor can parse and compute formulas using a sophisticated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 
                                            stored in each cell. This allows for more efficient and accurate evaluations of formula results.

                                            Cyclic Dependency Detection: One of the key features of the engine is its ability to detect 
                                            and manage cyclic dependencies between cells. This ensures that the processor does not enter an 
                                            infinite loop when a formula relies on the value of a cell that in turn depends on the original cell.

                                    Assignments focusing on core OS concepts such as multithreading synchronization and file system design. 
                                    Main emphasis on implementations of classical problems like producer-consumer, 
                                    and the creation of a custom file system inspired by the FAT architecture.

                                    This collection covers advanced operating systems topics through hands-on projects in C++. 
                                    The first project tackled multithreading synchronization, implementing a classical producer-consumer problem. 
                                    The solution required careful management of threads and synchronization primitives to ensure safe and efficient data exchange, 
                                    demonstrating solid understanding of concurrency control.
                                </p>

                                    The second project involved designing and implementing a simplified custom file system modeled similarly to the FAT architecture. 
                                    This task required creating a working interface for file management, including allocation tables and file metadata handling, 
                                    showcasing practical skills in low-level systems programming and file system internals.
                                </p>
                                <p data-i18n="osProjectsLong3">
                                    Working on these projects helped me develop stronger problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of essential OS concepts. 
                                    Through practical application of C++ coding techniques, I gained valuable experience that I hope will be useful in future system-level development.
